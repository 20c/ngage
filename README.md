## Synopsis

This is a joining of various automation scripts I've used in various places. As I switch things over to use this, I'll merge features and probably change some interfaces. Currently it should be considered a beta script as code is merged and tested. All components are used in production, but obviously the merge process may introduce bugs and growing pains.
